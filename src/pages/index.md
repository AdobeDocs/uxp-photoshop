# UXP for Adobe Photoshop documentation

UXP (**U**nified E**x**tensibility **P**latform) lets you build plugins for Photoshop and other Creative Cloud apps. Automate workflows, build new features, and connect to other software and servicesâ€”all with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This documentation helps developers build plugins for Adobe Photoshop versions 22.0 and later. If you're building plugins for earlier versions of Photoshop, see the [CEP Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides).

UXP provides modern JavaScript, a curated selection of UI components, and a more streamlined workflow for plugin developers.

With UXP, you can develop:

- Direct Actions - headless plugins that interface with Photoshop, the host OS, and the network, free of any UI.
- Modal Dialogs - plugins that implement one or more modal dialogs. Good for simple user interfaces that don't need to persist.
- Panels - full-featured panels that look like any other panel in Photoshop. UXP panels can contain as complex a UI as you wish to develop. They can be resized, docked, opened and closed just like native Photoshop panels. And with appropriate CSS constructs, your UXP panels can be theme-aware and change as the user switches UI themes in Photoshop.

**IMPORTANT**:
While this documentation set talks exclusively about Photoshop plugins created using UXP, earlier methods of controlling Photoshop, including CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) and ExtendScript continue to be supported. Over time these earlier technologies will be deprecated and then removed from Photoshop, but there is no need to rush to convert your existing plugins to UXP.
