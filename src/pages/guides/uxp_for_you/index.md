# New to UXP? Where to Go Next
The answer to that question depends on what you currently know.
- If you've created UXP plugins for other Adobe applications (e.g., XD) and just need to know what's different for Photoshop, [start here](uxp_for_xd_devs/).
- If you're unfamiliar with UXP, but have built extensions for Photoshop using the CEP (Common Extensibility Platform), [start here](uxp_for_cep_devs/).
- If you've never used UXP nor CEP, but _have_ written scripts using Adobe ExtendScript, [start here](uxp_for_extendscript_devs/).
- If you've never scripted Photoshop using the above technologies, but you know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, [start here](uxp_for_web_devs/).
- If you are a total newbie at all of this, good for you! [Start here to begin your awesome journey](uxp_for_newbies/).
