# Distribution Options

Once you have a packaged plugin, you're ready to distribute it. Here are your options:

<SummaryBlock slots="heading, text, buttons" background="rgb(141, 52, 78)" />

## Distribute on Creative Cloud Plugin Marketplace

Use the Developer Distribution portal to submit your plugin to the Plugin Marketplace to reach a large number of users.
Users can download your plugin directly in the Creative Cloud desktop app.

## Direct distribution with `.ccx` files

Give the plugin to your family, friends, and workmates. You can email the `.ccx` file or, more likely, put it on a cloud folder somewhere for them to download. All they need to do is double click the `.ccx` file to install using the Creative Cloud application. It's that easy! Be aware that distributing this way will require them to click through the "do you trust this?" warning dialog boxes that appear after they double-click.
