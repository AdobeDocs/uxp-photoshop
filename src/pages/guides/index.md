# Getting Started with UXP for Photoshop

## Hello World

Building your first UXP plugin requires two pieces of software, both of which can be installed via [Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html) - the latest version of Photoshop, and the [UXP Developer Tool](./devtool/installation/).

To get started, we suggest following these tutorials to get your hands dirty and get started with building UXP plugins for Photoshop:

1. [Creating your first plugin](./getting-started/creating-your-first-plugin/index.md)
2. [Editing the document](./getting-started/editing-the-document/index.md)
3. [Writing a file with UXP](./getting-started/writing-a-file/index.md)
