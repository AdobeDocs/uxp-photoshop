# Getting Started with UXP for Photoshop

## Hello World

Building your first UXP plugin requires two pieces of software, both of which can be installed via [Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html) - the latest Photoshop, and the [UXP Developer Tool](./devtool/installation/).

While you download and install both, we suggest reading up on the following:

### The Basics

- [The UXP manifest](./uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/): Essential to tailoring your UXP plugin.
- [UXP Developer Tool Walkthrough](./devtool/udt-walkthrough/): Learn how to create a plugin from a sample, load and debug it on Photoshop.
- [The intro to the Photoshop API](../ps_reference/): Explore what is offered in the form of the DOM API, the successor to ExtendScript.
- [Spectrum UI reference](../uxp/reference-spectrum/User%20Interface/): UXP provides a smaller set of elements that you should be aware of, before creating UI.

### Must Reads
- [UXP API reference](../uxp/): The UXP platform offers many, but not all capabilities of a web browser. Learn about what could be familiar, and what is different.
- [Modal Execution in Photoshop](../ps_reference/media/executeasmodal/): A new paradigm for building performant and resilient plugins. If you are building plugins that modifies the users' document, this is an essential read.
- [Photoshop manifest](./uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/photoshop-manifest/): An addendum to `manifest.json`. For Adobe Photoshop 2022, you will need to be aware of potential breaking changes related to Modal Execution.
