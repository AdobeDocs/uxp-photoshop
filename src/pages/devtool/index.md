# Adobe UXP Developer Tool

The Adobe UXP Developer Tool makes it easy to create, load, debug, and package UXP-based plugins.


## Overview

The Adobe UXP Developer Tool allows you to manage plugins that you are developing for Photoshop (and other UXP-powered host applications). This tool makes it easy to create plugins based on templates, and also load and debug plugins that you're building.
