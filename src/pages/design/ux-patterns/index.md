# UX patterns

The UX patterns section includes requirements and best practices to ensure that your plugin follows Adobe user experience patterns.

* [Designing for Photoshop](Designingforphotoshop/)
* [Branding](branding/)
* [Messaging](messaging/)
* [Onboarding](onboarding/)


## UX requirements

UX requirements highlight key patterns that all plugins need to follow in order to get approved by Adobe.

## UX best practices

Best practices provide recommendations on plugin usability and behavior, user feedback, privacy, and interface guidelines. 
These use “do” and “don’t” examples to illustrate the recommendations.
