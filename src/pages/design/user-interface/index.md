It covers everything from the components available in UXP to building a layout. For guidance around the UX of a plugin and best practices refer to [UX patterns](./ux-patterns/index.md).

Spectrum UXP allows UI to be the same for plugins across XD and Photoshop. 

Below is al ist to all the components available in UXP and the Spectrum design gudelines. 

**[Action button](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/action-button/)** - 
Action buttons allow users to perform an action or mark a selection. They’re used for similar, task-based options within a workflow, and are ideal for interfaces where buttons aren’t meant to draw a lot of attention.

**[Button](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/button/)** - 
Buttons allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.

**[Checkbox](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/checkbox/)** - 
Checkboxes allow users to select multiple items from a list of individual items, or to mark one individual item as selected.

**[Divider](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/divider/)** - 
Dividers bring clarity to a layout by grouping and dividing content in close proximity. They can also be used to establish rhythm and hierarchy.

**[Link](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/link/)** - 
Links allow users to navigate to a different location. They can be presented inline inside a paragraph or as standalone text.

**[Picker](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/picker/)** - 
Pickers (sometimes known as "dropdowns" or "selects") allow users to choose from a list of options in a limited space. The list of options can change based on the context.

**[Radio Button](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/radio-button/)** - 
Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list of mutually exclusive options. All possible options are exposed up front for users to compare.

**[Slider](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/slider/)** - 
Sliders allow users to quickly select a value within a range. They should be used when the upper and lower bounds to the range are invariable.

**[Text Field](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/text-field/)** - 
Text fields are text boxes that allow users to input custom text entries with a keyboard. Various options can be shown with the field to communicate the input requirements.

**[Tooltip](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/tooltip/)** - 
Tooltips allow users to get contextual help or information about specific components when hovering or focusing on them.

**[Typography](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/heading/)** -
