# Designing a plugin experience

These guidelines will help you define the best user experience for your plugin. As you create a plugin, consider different UX patterns and UI components based on your user’s workflow and the plugin action.
 
 Plugins can interact with a user’s experience at different levels, for example, some plugins in some use cases won’t render an interface, and some will include actions that need an interface.



 
 
## Designing a plugin

**Learn more about the types interfaces available to plugins.**


| **Plugins panel**   | **Plugins dialog**   |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| **non-blocking UI:** This interface is best used when the user should have access to the canvas while using the plugin.   | **blocking UI:** This interface is best used when the plugin needs to run an action and the user shouldn’t modify or change selection of objects on the canvas.   |
