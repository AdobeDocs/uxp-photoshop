To support this, you can override the top-level icons entry by adding another entry into your plugin\'s entrypoint. For example:\n\n')),Object(a.mdx)("p",null,'  "entrypoints": [\n{\n"type": "panel",\n"id": "runPanel",\n"icons": [\n{\n"width": 23, "height": 23, "path": "icons/run-dark.png", "scale": ',"[ 1, 2 ]",',\n"theme": ','[ "darkest", "dark" ]','\n}, {\n"width": 23, "height": 23, "path": "icons/run-light.png", "scale": ',"[ 1, 2 ]",',\n"theme": ','[ "lightest", "light" ]','\n}\n]\n}\n],\n"icons": [\n{\n"width": 23, "height": 23, "path": "icons/plugin-dark.png", "scale": ',"[ 1, 2 ]",',\n"theme": ','[ "darkest", "dark" ]','\n}, {\n"width": 23, "height": 23, "path": "icons/plugin-light.png", "scale": ',"[ 1, 2 ]",',\n"theme": ','[ "lightest", "light" ]',"\n}\n]"),Object(a.mdx)("pre",null,Object(a.mdx)("code",Object(o.a)({parentName:"pre"},{}),"\nIn the above example, the runPanel panel will show a separate icon.\n\n> You should supply a separate icon for each panel you support.
