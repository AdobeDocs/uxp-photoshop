This layer will be familiar to those who have used ExtendScript DOM.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Underneath, Photoshop exposes `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`batchPlay`}</inlineCode>{`, which takes an array of JSON objects (`}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`ActionDescriptors`}</inlineCode>{`), and injects the described actions into Photoshop event system. If you're familiar with ExtendScript or CEP, batchPlay is the evolution of `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`executeAction`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`executeActionGet`}</inlineCode>{`. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The second layer will provide pure functions around creating the said `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`ActionDescriptors`}</inlineCode>{`, which can all be fed to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`batchPlay`}</inlineCode>{`.

This layer is still under construction.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Internally, we have been using `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`batchPlay`}</inlineCode>{` in features like Learn Panel, and even our automation testing. While very powerful, this API requires knowledge of Photoshop codebase to use effectively. `}</p>\n    <p>{`With these DOM APIs, our motivation is to abstract away `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`batchPlay`}</inlineCode>{` completely, but it's still there if you'd like to use it and the descriptor layer should help make it easier to use.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"asynchrony-vs-synchrony\"\n    }}>{`Asynchrony vs Synchrony`}</h3>\n    <p>{`In ExtendScript, all DOM methods were synchronous, and would also block the UI. With UXP, the calls made into Photoshop can either be asynchronous\nor synchronous. We are designing our DOM APIs very carefully to be synchronous where it makes sense, and asynchronous for more expensive operations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Our rule of thumb, for now, is that properties of models are synchronous. Methods affecting the models, particularly ones that create new models\nwill be asynchronous.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We hope that our APIs are simple enough that this will not be a big learning curve.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
