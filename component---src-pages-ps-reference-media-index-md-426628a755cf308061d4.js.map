We are designing our DOM APIs very carefully to be synchronous where it makes sense, and asynchronous for more expensive operations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Our rule of thumb, for now, is that properties of models are synchronous. Methods affecting the models, particularly ones that create new models\nwill be asynchronous.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We hope that our APIs are simple enough that this will not be a big learning curve.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
