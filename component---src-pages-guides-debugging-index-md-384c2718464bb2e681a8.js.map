The simplest way, suitable for many plugins, is to use the UXP Developer Tool.

The best thing about the UXP Developer Tool is that you can choose `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Watch`}</inlineCode>{` from the Actions menu, and the tool will automatically reload your plugin whenever you've changed your JavaScript, HTML, or CSS files.

That doesn't mean it's easy, though. The smallest glitch in your JSON manifest file (a misplaced bracket, a missing comma, etc.) can cause your plugin to fail to load. You can use a JSON linter (one is built into VS code, and there are many available online both as apps and built into websites).

For UXP plugins, it's not as bad because the CSS is only targeting one \"browser.\" On the other hand, CSS bugs are often difficult to track down. Selective refinement is one way to track CSS bugs (comment out or cut parts of CSS definitions until you see something change).`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can also check the Debug window; the leftmost `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Elements`}</inlineCode>{` menu lets you expand the HTML in your plugin.
